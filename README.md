This repository contains the source code for working on a containerised Neovim
environment. I use this project to experiment with various Neovim configurations
which otherwise would be difficult on my work environment. Containerising a
Neovim environment takes away the pain of backing older configuration &
replacing them once I'm done experimenting with newer Neovim configurations.

So, if you work with or have a keen interest in using Neovim, this containerised
environment is perfect for experimentation. You simply need to _pull_ the Docker
image from the registry, see how things work out & delete the container (_and
the image_) after you're done!

## ü¶Æ How to Use the Project

The project is easy to use but before you get started using the project, there
are a few prerequisite tools you'll need in your local system. So ensure you at
least have the following tools installed before proceeding ahead:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- A modern Terminal Emulator (I suggest going with
  [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty))

With the prerequisite tools downloaded & setup, run the following command on
your preferred terminal:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/jarmos-san/neovim-docker:main
docker run -it --rm ghcr.io/jarmos-san/neovim-docker

# For local development, copy the Neovim configurations from the source code
# repository & then run the following commands to build an ephemeral container.
# docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/root/.config/nvim ghcr.io/jarmos-san/neovim-docker
```

The command will open up an interactive Neovim instance & the built container
will also be immediately removed when you exit the Neovim environment!

## Installing Plugins & Post-Setup Tasks

With the Neovim Docker container download & spun up, its time to install the
necessary plugins & perform some post-setup tasks like downloading LSP servers.
This section details some of those tasks which needs to be performed after
setting up Neovim.

**Installing Plugins with `packer.nvim`**:

The container come packaged with `git` for Neovim to download & setup the
[`packer.nvim`][1] package manager for Neovim. To help it install all the
necessary plugins, run `:PackerSync` in _Command_ mode.

Additionally, you could also perform a headless plugin installation by invoking
the following command:

```shell
nvim --headless -c "autocmd User PackerComplete quitall" -c "PackerSync"
```

**Installing LSP Servers with `mason.nvim`**:

Neovim comes with a builtin LSP client but the individual servers has to be
downloaded seperately. Unfortunately, the said servers are often distributed
through multiple package managers like `npm`, `brew` & so on.

Keeping a track of all the package manager & which manager is responsible to
download which LSP server can be difficult to track. Hence, to help with such
scenarios, the [`mason.nvim`][2] plugin helps a lot to automate LSP server
installation.

That said, invoking `:MasonToolInstall` in _Command_ mode will install all the
necessary LSP servers that you've configured `mason.nvim` to handle.

## üìö Informative Resources for Learning About the Tools

Neovim has a significant learning curve but its worthwhile especially for
power-users (_and if you suffer from
[Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS)](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/carpal-tunnel-syndrome-fact-sheet)_).
So for all the beginners out there, following are some resources which you might
find useful while learning the tools in use:

- [OpenVim](https://www.openvim.com) which is an web-based platform to learn
  more about navigating around in Vim (_or Neovim_).
- [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com) is a web-based game for teaching
  Vim in a fun, interactive format.
- [Docker Playground](https://www.docker.com/play-with-docker) to learn Docker
  right from within your favourite browser.
